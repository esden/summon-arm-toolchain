REMEMBER!
=========
THE RESULTING TOOLCHAIN IS FOR BARE BONE ARM PROCESSOR SOFTWARE. NOT FOR USE
WITH GLIBC OR THE LINUX KERNEL. DO NOT EVEN BOTHER TO ASK FOR THAT!

To compile the ARM toolchain for barebone ARM devices:
======================================================
* Run ./summon-arm-toolchain
* Profit

Command line options
====================

You can suffix the script call with the following variable parameters:

TARGET=
-------

By default the target is arm-none-eabi, you may want to use a different target, for example arm-elf. Use that option on your own risk it may brake things.

PREFIX=
-------

By default the installation prefix is "$(HOME)/sat" you can change it to "/usr" then the binaries will be installed into "/usr/bin" and the toolchain specific files in "/usr/arm-none-eabi" assuming you did not change the TARGET variable.

DARWIN_OPT_PATH=
----------------

When compiling on Mac OS X the build script has to know where MacPorts or Fink is installed. The default value is "/opt/local".

SUDO=
-----

By default this variable is empty. If you need root rights for the install step you may set this variable to "sudo".

./summon-arm-toolchain SUDO=sudo

This will prefix all make install steps with the sudo command asking for your root password.

QUIET=
------

By default set to 0. To decrease console output (may increase compile speed in some cases) you can set this variable to 1.

USE_LINARO=
-----------

By default set to 1. To disable the usage of the Linaro GCC and use of the vanilla GCC instead set to 0.

OOCD_EN=
--------

By default set to 1. To disable compilation of OpenOCD JTAG programming software set to 0.

LIBSTM32_EN=
------------

By default set to 0. To enable compilation of the non free libstm32 library set to 1.

LIBOPENSTM32_EN=
----------------

By default set to 1. To disable compilation of the open source libopenstm32 library set to 0.

DEFAULT_TO_CORTEX_M3=
---------------------

By default set to 0. To enable compilation of binutils and GCC to generate code for the Cortex-M3 ARM architecture by default set to 0. Tests have shown that using these options is not very reliable and is discouraged. It is more reliable to add the necessary options to your build environment instead.

CPUS=
-----

Overrides the autodetection of CPU cores on the host machine. This option is translated into the -j$CPUS+1 option to the make command when running the script.

Example:
--------

./summon-arm-toolchain LIBSTM32_EN=1 CPUS=5

this will run the script with libstm32 enabled and with 5 cpus on your host machine resulting in calling all make commands with -j6.

Currently tested and known to work target platforms:
====================================================

* STM32F10x (Olimex STM32-H103 eval board, Open-BLDC v0.1, v0.2, v0.3, v1.0)

Currently tested and known to work host platforms:
==================================================

* Linux 32bit and 64bit (Debian unstable)
* Mac OS X Snow Leopard with MacPorts

Notes for Mac OS X users:
=========================

You need to install gmp, mpfr, mpc and libiconv packages using MacPorts,
DarwinPorts or fink. GCC-4.5.1 requires them.

port install gmp mpfr libmpc

For xml support in gdb you may want to install expat too. And add the 
--with-expat parameter to GDB target.

Notes for Linux users:
======================

You need to install several packages on debian just run:

apt-get install flex bison libgmp3-dev libmpfr-dev libncurses5-dev \
libmpc-dev autoconf texinfo build-essential

You may want to try running the following comand instead too:

apt-get build-dep gcc-4.5

For xml support in gdb you may want to install libexpat1 and libexpat1-dev 
too. 

Usage notes:
============

As we support multilib now in SAT thanks to Eric Parsonage's and Bernard
Davison's amazing work. You want to use the following GCC flag combinations to
generate full fledged floating point supporting code for some selected
architectures.

* stm32 (probably cortex-m3 in general): -mthumb -march=armv7 -mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd -msoft-float
* lpc21 (thumb instruction set): -mthumb -msoft-float
* lpc21 (arm instruction set): -mthumb -march=armv4t -msoft-float

If you need support for some other arm mcu and know the parameters for it just drop us a line and we will add that combination to the multilibs.

You can list available combinations by running:
arm-none-eabi-gcc -print-multi-lib

How to submit improvements and patches
======================================

As more and more people start to submit patches and improvements to
Summon-Arm-Toolchain (SAT) this section seems to become necessary.

First of all any way of submission is appreciated, if you just want to dump
your version of the script to us feel free to do so. Still if you want your
improvements and fixes to go upstream quicker there is a good way to do that.

1) Create an account on GitHub. (or some other git hosting service, if you
   really have to)
2) Fork the main SAT repository.
3) Clone the forked repository to your disk
4) Change the script, try to make small changes adding one feature or bugfix at
   a time (That makes review much easier for us).
5) Push your changes to GitHub, or the other service you chose
6) Test your changes, by compiling the toolchain. (You probably want to do that
   with different options)
7) Make sure that everything still works
8) Test a little bit more
9) Click on pull request on GitHub or drop us a line so that we can pull your
   changes

I know that sounds like a lot of work, but if you don't we have to do it and that means that your awesome improvement or bugfix will take longer to be integrated into the official script. And as you we want everyone to profit from such changes sooner then later. :)
